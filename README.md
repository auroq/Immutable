This project contains implementations of a todo list library intended to try out working with immutable data structures.

## Instructions

Create a library for managing todo list items.

The library should do the following:

- Add a new item to the list
- Remove an item from the list
- Change the status of a todo list item
  - Incomplete
  - Progressing
  - Complete

All the relevant data structures (including the list of items) should be _immutable_.
All operations should be without side effects.
