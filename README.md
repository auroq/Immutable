This project contains implementations of a todo list library intended to try out working with immutable data structures.

## Instructions

Create a library for managing todo list items.

The library should do the following:

- Add a new item to the list
- Remove an item from the list
- Perform actions on a task to change its status
  - Actions
    - start work
    - stop work
    - complete task
  - Statuses
    - Incomplete
    - Progressing
    - Complete

All the relevant data structures (including the list of items) should be _immutable_.
All operations should be without side effects.
